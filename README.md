# goobooksite

This is a static site generator that uses rust to convert markdown files to a website. It's used in combination with gobook, to make it quick to publish cells that have been run in VS Code for docuemntation or blogging purposes.

The CICD is done with Netify.

To modify the notes, clone the repo and do:
```
mdbook serve
```
This will watch for changes and update your broswer in a live dev environment
