# What is gobook?

Gobook started as an extension to run Go interactivly in VS Code and save results to markdown ready for uploading to a blog or documentation sites. This site is a work in progress using the extension in combination with a [Rust static site generator](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), inspired by Rust's reverently referred to ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

```go
x := "gobook"
y := "mdbook"
fmt.Printf("This site was built with %s and %s", x, y)
```
```output
This site was built with gobook and mdbook
```
